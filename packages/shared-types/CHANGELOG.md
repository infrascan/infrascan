## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- [#82](https://github.com/infrascan/infrascan/pull/82) [`e28a6d9`](https://github.com/infrascan/infrascan/commit/e28a6d91eb36fa83e9a40a667eb39a15b2a45ccb) Thanks [@lfarrel6](https://github.com/lfarrel6)! - Introduce new readable/writable interface for @infrascan/core graph interface to make types nicer to work with. Previously, the graph returned union types to bridge the Graph's internal model of the state with its exposed API for adding children/parents/edges. This resulted in a lot of properties with signatures like `parent?: Node | string`.

  This has been updated to wrap the Node and Edge types in `Readable` and `Writable` types based on the context they're being used in. This is inspired by the Kysely `Selectable`/`Insertable` pattern. When a Node is `Readable` its edges, parent and children will resolve to other Node objects. When `Writable`, all other Nodes are expected to be referenced using a string type containing their ID.

  Introduce @infrascan/node-reducer-plugin which reduces graph complexity for dynamicially provisioned infrastructure.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 7d71a0e: Restructure the project into per service scanner modules. Each module must be registered with the SDK for the service to be scanned and graphed.

  The initial implementation for Infrascan used a single config file which defined the scanning approach for every service, and their graph structure. It very quickly became difficult to debug, and reason about. The core logic was also completely untestable in any sane way.

  This release is a rewrite of the entire project. The SDK by default will do nothing. Each individual service's scanner has to be registered into an instance of the SDK for it to be scanned or graphed. This reduces the SDK complexity massively, as it only needs to step through the registered services and call into their APIs.
