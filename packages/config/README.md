# @infrascan/config

The Infrascan Config defines the API calls and state resolution for the Infrascan SDK. 

The config is used as an input to the [codegen](https://github.com/infrascan/infrascan/tree/main/internal/codegen) project to generate typescript implementations for the AWS services.

The config is not designed to be consumed outside of the SDK and codegen services.
