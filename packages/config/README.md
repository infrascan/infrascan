# @infrascan/config

This folder contains the Infrascan Config. The Config defines the API calls and state resolution for the Infrascan SDK. The config is used as an input to the [codegen](../../internal/codegen) project to generate typescript implementations for the AWS services.

The config is not designed to be consumed outside of the SDK and codegen services.
